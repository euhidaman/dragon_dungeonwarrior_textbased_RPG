# dragon_dungeonwarrior_textbased_RPG

This is my first small scale project script in python.
This is a small script to demonstrate an RPG game in action.

Steps to play this game :
1. Clone this repository
2. Install/have python installed on your local machine
3. Run `python dragon_dungeonwarrior.py`

To see how it works, download and execute the script :)
